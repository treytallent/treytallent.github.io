### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Toggle the mobile menu (requires some JavaScript)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Initially I attempted this challenge using flexbox but found it very difficult. I decided to take time away from this challenge and reattempt it once I had learned the basics of CSS grid. Reattempting this challenge I learned the importance of CSS grid and how it's functionality provides simplicity in markup and further layout customisation that would otherwise be very difficult with flexbox.

### Continued development

- Add navigation functionality
- Simplify markup after further learning
